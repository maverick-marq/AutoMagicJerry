Edit docker-compose with VPN details.
Can replace expressVPN with any other service.
Will run without VPN properly configured.

run docker build .
add execute permissions to run-restart and launch with ./run-restart
should launch docker containers

VPN / Piratebay / act of god makes it go down a lot so just run ./run-restart again to solve most issues.
